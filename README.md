# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data even after a successful API fetch.  The bug is caused by a missing or incorrect keyExtractor function in the FlatList component. 

## Problem

The `MyComponent` fetches data from a remote API. Although the data is successfully fetched and logged to the console, the FlatList component remains blank. This is a typical scenario encountered by React Native developers. 

## Solution

The solution involves correctly implementing the `keyExtractor` prop in the FlatList component. The `keyExtractor` function should return a unique key for each item in the data array. This enables React to efficiently update and render the list items.
